### Traditional Approach Challenges

:::challenges

When planning trips, travel agents and individuals typically go through a labor-intensive process. Here’s a snapshot of the traditional steps involved:

1. **City Selection:** Analysts pore over multiple data sources to recommend the best city based on weather, seasonal events, and travel costs.
2. **Local Insights:** Gaining authentic insights about the city requires contacting local experts or extensive online research to understand attractions and customs.
3. **Itinerary Planning:** Constructing a detailed travel plan involves curating daily activities, dining options, and accommodations, often needing revisions to fit within budget constraints or schedule changes.

*Note: While this use case focuses on automating the selection and initial planning stages, some elements like real-time adjustments during the trip remain manual.*

### Traditional Approach Challenges

:::challenges

Typically, individuals manually compile their work history, skills, and educational background into a format that they hope will catch the eye of recruiters. This process includes:

1. **Information Gathering:** Manually collecting and organizing personal information, job history, skills, and education.
2. **Formatting:** Trying to format the resume in a way that is both attractive and professional without consistent guidelines.
3. **Content Writing:** Writing and rewriting content to ensure it is concise, compelling, and relevant to job applications.
4. **Proofreading and Editing:** Ensuring the resume is free from errors and polished to a professional standard.

*Note: In this use case, we focus on automating the extraction of structured information and the subsequent resume writing, which are typically manual and time-intensive tasks. These steps are typically manual and time-intensive, and while our solution automates the initial creation, tailoring resumes to specific job applications remains a critical aspect where human input is invaluable.*

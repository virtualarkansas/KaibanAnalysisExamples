### Traditional Approach Challenges



:::challenges

When reporting on significant sports events like the Copa America final, journalists traditionally follow a detailed, manual process. Below is an outline of the typical steps involved, highlighted for emphasis:

1. **Gathering Data:** Journalists comb through various sports websites to find the final score, player statistics, and key plays, all under the pressing deadlines.
2. **Interviews and Quotes:** Reporters quickly gather reactions from players and coaches, trying to capture the emotional aftermath of the match before their competitors.
3. **Writing and Structuring:** Back in the newsroom, writers piece together their findings, striving to create a narrative that captures the essence of the game.
4. **Editing and Publishing:** Editors polish the articles for clarity and engagement, racing against time to publish while the news is still fresh.

*Note: In this use case, the publishing step is not currently automated by KaibanJS to maintain simplicity in the workflow.*

### The Agentic Solution
Now, imagine this scenario optimized with KaibanJS automation:

- **Event:** Copa America Final, 2024
- **Query:** "Who won the Copa America in 2024?"

Before diving into the process, let's understand the roles of the **key Agents** involved:

**Scout Agent:** This agent is responsible for automated data collection. As soon as the game concludes, the Scout Agent springs into action, using advanced algorithms to retrieve detailed game data such as scores, player performances, and key moments—all in real time and without human intervention.

**Writer Agent:** After data collection, the Writer Agent takes over. This agent processes the collected data to generate engaging and accurate content. It crafts articles that not only report the facts but also weave in narrative elements such as player quotes and strategic analyses, creating stories that capture the drama and excitement of the game.

#### Process Overview
Now that you are familiar with the agents and their roles, let's explore the process they follow to transform live game data into engaging content.

:::tasks
1. **Automated Data Collection:** As the final whistle blows, a Scout Agent immediately retrieves detailed game data. It captures Argentina’s dramatic 2-1 victory over Colombia, pinpointing key plays and standout player performances without human delay.

2. **Content Creation:** A Writer Agent rapidly processes this information, crafting an enthralling article titled "Argentina Edges Out Colombia: A Copa America Final to Remember." The piece spotlights Argentina’s strategic depth, featuring a decisive goal by Lionel Messi in the 78th minute and a late game-saving play by the goalkeeper. It integrates generated, but realistic, quotes based on player profiles and past interviews, adding a personal and insightful touch to the narrative.

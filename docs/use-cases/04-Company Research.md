It’s Saturday afternoon, and here I am, nearly four hours deep into researching companies like ours. So far, I've only managed to fully analyze two companies. It’s frustrating. With each passing hour, I’m reminded just how slow and piecemeal this traditional research process can be.

I’m gearing up for a crucial meeting with our advisors next week, and I need to bring my A-game.

**That’s when it hit me—why not use our own creation, KaibanJS, to streamline this?**

It's the perfect scenario to "eat our own dog food" and really put our platform to the test. I can't believe I didn’t think of this sooner, sticking to the old, manual ways of doing things.

Manual research is not just time-consuming; it's overwhelming. It involves digging through disparate data sources, which often results in incomplete insights. Each hour spent manually correlating data is an hour not spent on strategic analysis or decision-making.

### Traditional Approach Challenges

:::challenges

Conducting comprehensive company research typically includes several labor-intensive steps:

1. **Business Model Analysis:** Analysts manually search for information regarding the company’s revenue sources and scalability.
2. **Funding Research:** Gathering detailed data on a company’s funding rounds and investors requires access to financial databases and reports.
3. **Operational Insights:** Understanding a company’s operational strategies involves deep dives into internal processes and infrastructure, often requiring firsthand interviews or extensive document reviews.
4. **Exit Strategy Exploration:** Analyzing a company’s past exits and future plans necessitates historical data comparison and strategy evaluation.
5. **Market Position Assessment:** Determining a company’s market segmentation and brand strength involves analyzing market data and competitor performance.
6. **Customer Acquisition Studies:** Investigating effective customer acquisition channels and strategies requires data on marketing approaches and outcomes.

*Note: This use case automates the collection and analysis of data across these areas to produce a cohesive and comprehensive view of the company, traditionally done through manual research.*

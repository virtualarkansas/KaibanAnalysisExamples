> KaibanJS seamlessly integrates with popular JavaScript frameworks, including React, Vue, Angular, NextJS, and Node.js. This integration allows you to leverage AI agents within your existing frontend or backend architecture, enhancing your applications with advanced AI functionalities.

## Using KaibanJS with React

In a React application, you can easily incorporate KaibanJS to manage tasks and monitor statuses dynamically. Below is an example of a React component that uses KaibanJS to display the status of tasks managed by AI agents.

### Example: Task Status Component in React

This React component demonstrates how to connect to an KaibanJS team's store and display task statuses:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import myAgentsTeam from './agenticTeam';

const TaskStatusComponent = () => {
    const useTeamStore = myAgentsTeam.useStore();

    const { tasks } = useTeamStore(state => ({
        tasks: state.tasks.map(task => ({
            id: task.id,
            description: task.description,
            status: task.status
        }))
    }));

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Task Statuses</h1>
            <ul>
                {tasks.map(task => (
                    <li key={task.id}>
                        {task.description}: Status - {task.status}
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
};

export default TaskStatusComponent;
```

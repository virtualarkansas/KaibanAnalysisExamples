# Human in the Loop (HITL)

## Overview
Human in the Loop (HITL) is a core feature in KaibanJS that enables manual intervention and oversight in AI-driven tasks. It provides a mechanism for human operators to review, provide input, or make decisions at critical points in the workflow, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and ethical considerations in complex or sensitive operations.

## Purpose
The HITL feature addresses the need for human judgment in scenarios where:
- Tasks reach a complexity level beyond AI capabilities
- Sensitive decisions require human oversight
- Quality assurance is critical
- Ethical considerations necessitate human involvement

## Human in the Loop (HITL)

Imagine a Kanban board for a software development team:

```
| To Do | In Progress | Code Review | Testing | Done |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|------|
| Task 1 | Task 2     | Task 3      | Task 4  | Task 5 |
|       |             | <Needs      |         |      |
|       |             |  Human      |         |      |
|       |             |  Review>    |         |      |
```

In this scenario, Task 3 in the "Code Review" column requires human intervention. This is similar to how HITL works in AI workflows, where certain tasks need human input or validation before proceeding.

### How HITL Works in KaibanJS

1. **Task Creation**: Tasks are created and can be flagged to require human validation.

2. **AI Processing**: AI agents work on tasks, moving them through different states (like "To Do" to "In Progress").

3. **Human Intervention Points**: 
   - Tasks enter 'AWAITING_VALIDATION' state when they need human review.
   - Humans can provide feedback on tasks in 'BLOCKED', 'AWAITING_VALIDATION', or even 'DONE' states.

4. **Feedback or Validation**: 
   - Humans can validate (approve) a task or provide feedback for revisions.
   - Feedback can be given to guide the AI's next steps or to request changes.

5. **Feedback Processing**: 
   - If feedback is provided, the task moves to 'REVISE' state.
   - The AI agent then addresses the feedback, potentially moving the task back to 'DOING'.

6. **Completion**: Once validated, tasks move to the 'DONE' state.

This process ensures that human expertise is incorporated at crucial points, improving the overall quality and reliability of the AI-driven workflow.

### This HITL workflow can be easily implemented using KaibanJS. 

The library provides methods and status to manage the entire process programmatically:

- Methods: `validateTask()`, `provideFeedback()`, `getTasksByStatus()`
- Task Statuses: TODO, DOING, BLOCKED, REVISE, AWAITING_VALIDATION, VALIDATED, DONE
- Workflow Status: INITIAL, RUNNING, BLOCKED, FINISHED
- Feedback History: Each task contains a `feedbackHistory` array, with entries consisting of:
  - `content`: The human input or decision
  - `status`: PENDING or PROCESSED
  - `timestamp`: When the feedback was created or last updated

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to set up and manage a HITL workflow using KaibanJS:

```js
// Creating a task that requires validation
const task = new Task({
    title: "Analyze market trends",
    description: "Research and summarize current market trends for our product",
    assignedTo: "Alice",
    externalValidationRequired: true
});

// Set up the workflow status change listener before starting
team.onWorkflowStatusChange((status) => {
  if (status === 'BLOCKED') {
    // Check for tasks awaiting validation
    const tasksAwaitingValidation = team.getTasksByStatus('AWAITING_VALIDATION');
    
    tasksAwaitingValidation.forEach(task => {
      console.log(`Task awaiting validation: ${task.title}`);
      
      // Example: Automatically validate the task
      team.validateTask(task.id);
      
    // Alternatively, provide feedback if the task needs revision
    // This could be based on human review or automated criteria
    // team.provideFeedback(task.id, "Please include more data on competitor pricing.");
    });
  } else if (status === 'FINISHED') {
    console.log('Workflow completed successfully!');
    console.log('Final result:', team.getWorkflowResult());
  }
});

// Start the workflow and handle the promise
team.start()
  .then((output) => {
    if (output.status === 'FINISHED') {
      console.log('Workflow completed with result:', output.result);
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Workflow encountered an error:', error);
  });
```
## Task Statuses
The system includes the following task statuses, which apply to all tasks throughout the entire workflow, including but not limited to HITL processes:

- `TODO`: Task is queued for initiation, awaiting processing.
- `DOING`: Task is actively being worked on by an agent.
- `BLOCKED`: Progress on the task is halted due to dependencies or obstacles.
- `REVISE`: Task requires additional review or adjustments based on feedback.
- `AWAITING_VALIDATION`: Task is completed but requires validation or approval.
- `VALIDATED`: Task has been validated and confirmed as correctly completed.
- `DONE`: Task is fully completed and requires no further action.

These statuses are defined in the [TASK_STATUS_enum](https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS/blob/main/src/utils/enums.js#L58) and can be accessed throughout the system for consistency.

```

## Task State Transitions

1. **TODO to DOING**: 
   - When a task is picked up by an agent to work on.

2. **DOING to BLOCKED**: 
   - If the task encounters an obstacle or dependency that prevents progress.

3. **DOING to AWAITING_VALIDATION**: 
   - Only for tasks created with `externalValidationRequired = true`.
   - Occurs when the agent completes the task but it needs human validation.

4. **DOING to DONE**: 
   - For tasks that don't require external validation.
   - When the agent successfully completes the task.

5. **AWAITING_VALIDATION to VALIDATED**: 
   - When a human approves the task without changes.

6. **AWAITING_VALIDATION to REVISE**: 
   - If the human provides feedback or requests changes during validation.

7. **VALIDATED to DONE**: 
   - Automatic transition after successful validation.

8. **REVISE to DOING**: 
   - When the agent starts working on the task again after receiving feedback.

9. **BLOCKED to DOING**: 
    - When the obstacle is removed and the task can proceed.

## HITL Workflow Integration

1. **Requiring External Validation**: 
   - Set `externalValidationRequired: true` when creating a task to ensure it goes through human validation before completion.

2. **Initiating HITL**: 
   - Use `team.provideFeedback(taskId, feedbackContent)` at any point to move a task to REVISE state.

3. **Validating Tasks**:
   - Use `team.validateTask(taskId)` to approve a task, moving it from AWAITING_VALIDATION to VALIDATED, then to DONE.
   - Use `team.provideFeedback(taskId, feedbackContent)` to request revisions, moving the task from AWAITING_VALIDATION to REVISE.

4. **Processing Feedback**:
   - The system automatically processes feedback given through the `provideFeedback()` method.
   - Agents handle pending feedback before continuing with the task.

## Feedback in HITL

In KaibanJS, human interventions are implemented through a feedback system. Each task maintains a `feedbackHistory` array to track these interactions.

### Feedback Structure

Each feedback entry in the `feedbackHistory` consists of:
- `content`: The human input or decision
- `status`: The current state of the feedback
- `timestamp`: When the feedback was created or last updated

### Feedback Statuses
KaibanJS uses two primary statuses for feedback:
- `PENDING`: Newly added feedback that hasn't been addressed yet
- `PROCESSED`: Feedback that has been successfully addressed and incorporated

This structure allows for clear tracking of human interventions and their resolution throughout the task lifecycle.

## React Example

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { team } from './teamSetup'; // Assume this is where your team is initialized

function WorkflowBoard() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  const [workflowStatus, setWorkflowStatus] = useState('');
  const store = team.useStore();

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribeTasks = store.subscribe(
      state => state.tasks,
      (tasks) => setTasks(tasks)
    );

    const unsubscribeStatus = store.subscribe(
      state => state.teamWorkflowStatus,
      (status) => setWorkflowStatus(status)
    );

    return () => {
      unsubscribeTasks();
      unsubscribeStatus();
    };
  }, []);

  const renderTaskColumn = (status, title) => (
    <div className="task-column">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {tasks.filter(task => task.status === status).map(task => (
        <div key={task.id} className="task-card">
          <h3>{task.title}</h3>
          <p>{task.description}</p>
          {status === 'AWAITING_VALIDATION' && (
            <button onClick={() => store.getState().validateTask(task.id)}>
              Validate
            </button>
          )}
          <button onClick={() => store.getState().provideFeedback(task.id, "Sample feedback")}>
            Provide Feedback
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );

  return (
    <div className="task-board">
      <h1>Task Board - Workflow Status: {workflowStatus}</h1>
      <div className="columns-container">
        {renderTaskColumn('TODO', 'To Do')}
        {renderTaskColumn('DOING', 'In Progress')}
        {renderTaskColumn('BLOCKED', 'Blocked')}
        {renderTaskColumn('AWAITING_VALIDATION', 'Waiting for Feedback')}
        {renderTaskColumn('DONE', 'Done')}
      </div>
      <button onClick={() => store.getState().startWorkflow()}>Start Workflow</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default WorkflowBoard;
```

## Conclusion

By implementing Human in the Loop through KaibanJS's feedback and validation system, you can create a more robust, ethical, and accurate task processing workflow. This feature ensures that critical decisions benefit from human judgment while maintaining the efficiency of automated processes for routine operations.

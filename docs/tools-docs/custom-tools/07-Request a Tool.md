# Request a Tool

Is there a tool you'd love to see integrated with KaibanJS? We want to hear about it! Your input helps us prioritize new integrations and ensure KaibanJS meets the community's needs.

## How to Request

1. **Check Existing Tools**: First, make sure the tool you're looking for doesn't already exist in our documentation or isn't currently under development.

2. **Submit a Request**: 
   - Open an issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS)
   - Use the title format: "Tool Request: [Tool Name]"
   - In the description, explain:
     - What the tool does
     - Why it would be valuable for KaibanJS users
     - Any relevant links or documentation for the tool

3. **Community Discussion**: Other users can comment on and upvote tool requests, helping us prioritize integrations.

## Participate in Discussions

Once you've submitted a request, or if you see a request you're interested in:
- Engage in the discussion thread
- Provide additional use cases or scenarios
- Upvote requests you find valuable

Your active participation helps us understand the importance and potential impact of each requested tool.

## Installation

Before using the tool, ensure that you have created an API Key at [SearchApi](https://www.searchapi.io/) to enable search functionality.

## Example

Utilize the SearchApi tool as follows to enable your agent to perform searches with customizable engines:

```js
import { SearchApi } from '@langchain/community/tools/searchapi';

const searchTool = new SearchApi('ENV_SEARCH_API_KEY', {
  engine: "google_news",
});

const informationRetriever = new Agent({
    name: 'Mary', 
    role: 'Information Retriever', 
    goal: 'Gather and present the most relevant and up-to-date information from various online sources.', 
    background: 'Search Specialist',
    tools: [searchTool]
});
```

## Parameters

- `apiKey` **Required**. The API key generated from [SearchApi](https://www.searchapi.io/). Set `'ENV_SEARCH_API_KEY'` as an environment variable or replace it directly with your API key.
- `engine` **Optional**. The search engine you want to use. Some options include `"google_news"`, `"bing"`, and others, depending on what is supported by SearchApi.

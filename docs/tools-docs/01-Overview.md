description: An introduction to KaibanJS tools, including pre-integrated LangChain tools and custom tool development, enhancing AI agent capabilities for various tasks and integrations.
---

Welcome to the Tools Documentation for KaibanJS, where we guide you through the powerful capabilities that tools add to your AI agents. This section is designed to help you understand and utilize a diverse array of tools, ranging from internet searches to complex data analysis and automation tasks.

## What is a Tool?

> A Tool is a skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions:
>
> - Search on the Internet
> - Calculate data or predictions
> - Automate data entry tasks
>

## Understanding the Tool Sections

KaibanJS enhances the functionality of your agents through two primary tool categories:

- **[KaibanJS Tools](/category/kaibanjs-tools)**
- **[LangChain Tools](/category/langchain-tools)**
- **[Custom Tools](/category/custom-tools)**

Both sections are accessible through the sidebar/menu, where you can explore detailed documentation and resources.


### KaibanJS Tools

KaibanJS Tools are pre-integrated tools that are ready to use out of the box. We've tested and verified a subset to work seamlessly with KaibanJS, which you'll find listed in the sidebar. 

### LangChain Tools

Developed and maintained by the [LangChain team](https://langchain.com/), they're ready to use out of the box. We've tested and verified a subset to work seamlessly with KaibanJS, which you'll find listed in the sidebar. 

While LangChain offers many [more tools](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/tools/), we haven't tested them all yet. That said, we're happy to add more to the list, so please let us know which ones you'd like to see.

### Custom Tools

This section is for developers who want to create tools tailored to their specific needs or projects. It provides resources for building and integrating unique tools that go beyond the standard LangChain offerings:

- **Custom Tool Tutorial:** A step-by-step guide on how to create your own custom tool for KaibanJS.
- **Example Tools:** Showcases of custom tools to inspire and guide your development process.

JavaScript developers can leverage NPM's vast resources to create custom tools, extending KaibanJS's capabilities and integrating with numerous libraries and services.
